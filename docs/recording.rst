**Recordings working in isolation**

Like Tests, the goal of Recordings is to make them self-contained units.
Especially if you are recording transactions with a live api (not recommended
unless readonly). That means cleaning up the recording, if possible. It won't
always be possible - but in 99 percent of those occasions it won't matter.

During development you'll be calling those transacations anyway (although you
could you use the recording in a view :-)  Trashing the database with junk test
data is precisely the point of a test api.

So it wouldn't matter if you needed to record the scenario again after
developing the method it tests. Even if the state of the database has changed
since the earlier recording, the new one should provide a single unit of data
to pass the test, and protect it from future errors.

It shouldn't even matter if your recording contains data which has since been
deleted from the api.

Your Recording is custom built for your Test - and while any methods are
decorated @api_recorder, your Test has no other route to the data they posses -
until the method is released from playback.

***Use a Recording as the template for a Test.***

First copy and paste your recording into a test_it.py file. Then change:

::

  def record_marshall_register_users(can_overwrite):

To:

::

  def test_marshall_register_users():

... removing the "can_overwrite" parameter.

Don't change!

::

  scenario_name = 'record_marshall_change_passwords'
  """The name recorded must match the test."""

Remove:

::

  if not can_overwrite:
      if scenario_exists(site_name, scenario_name):
          return

Change:

::

  start_recording_scenario(site_name, scenario_name)

To:

::

  load_scenario(site_name, scenario_name)

Ignore the rest for now. At the bottom of the method change:

::

    end_and_save_scenario(site_name, scenario_name)

To

::

    unload_scenario(site_name, scenario_name)
    """Effectively: eject the cassette.

Checklist:

  1) Change "recording_" in method name to "test_"
  2) Leave the scenario_name.
  3) Remove "overwrite" protection.
  4) Change "start_recording_scenario" to "load_scenario".
  5) Leave the rest for now as resources for a test.
  6) Change "end_and_save_scenario" to "unload_scenario" as the last.



**Skeleton of a Test.**

::

  from ghosts.decorators.tests.recording_management import (
      load_scenario,
      unload_scenario,
  )

  site_name = settings.site_name

  def test_marshall_register_users():

    load_scenario(site_name, scenario_name)

    unload_scenario(site_name, scenario_name)


**Example of Test.**

For a start, Anywhere it says "Recording:" in the recording method above is
likely to be something whose return value you will want to test stays the same
while you are developing.

So just change "Recording:" to "Testing", run the same command, then test it.
