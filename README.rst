pyghosts
****

In remembrance of "12ghosts" (a handy utility suite of Windows shortcuts - which
I loved), pyghost similarly collects my python shortcuts to common tasks.

pyghosts is both a convenient collection of useful functions which aren't worth
their own repo.

There are currently 3 ghosts:

- decorators: contains api_recorder and api_automock.
- ioioio: contains pinpoint with useful os path tricks.
- stringy: contains btweex to find strings between strings.
